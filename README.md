Project Objectives
This project analyzes air quality data from Uttar Pradesh (2005) to uncover pollution trends, identify critical issues, and visualize key insights. The objectives are divided into five key areas:


1.City-Wise Air Pollution Comparison

Compare pollution levels (PM10) across different cities in Uttar Pradesh.

Identify the most and least polluted cities.

Visualize rankings using bar charts to highlight disparities.



2.Monthly Air Pollution Trend Analysis

Track how pollution levels (PM10, SO₂, NO₂) fluctuate month by month.

Determine if pollution peaks during specific seasons (e.g., winter, summer).

Visualize trends with line graphs to show cyclical patterns.



3.Most Polluted Day Identification

Pinpoint the single worst day for air quality in 2005 based on PM10 levels.

Compare this day’s pollution to the annual average.

Highlight the outlier using a scatter plot.



4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summarize key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for pollutants.

Analyze correlations between pollutants (e.g., PM10 vs. NO₂).

Visualize trends over time (line plots) and pollution distribution (box plots/heatmaps).



5.Pollution Distribution Analysis

Understand how often extreme, moderate, or low pollution levels occur.

Plot histograms for PM10, SO₂, and NO₂ to show frequency distributions.

Identify common pollution ranges (e.g., most days fall under "moderate" PM10 levels).



Key Insights
Ghaziabad was the most polluted city; Gajraula the least.

The highest PM10 level (626 µg/m³) was recorded on December 11, 2005.

Winter months showed elevated pollution, likely due to weather and human activity.

Weak correlation between PM10 and NO₂/SO₂ suggests diverse pollution sources.
